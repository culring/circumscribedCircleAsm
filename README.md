# circumscribedTriangleAsm

Fully written in MIPS assembly language project that enables drawing a triangle with its circumcircle given coordinates of triangle's vertices (only 24-bit bitmaps supported).

Following algorithms used:
  * Bresenham's line algorithm for drawing a triangle
  * midpoint circle algorihtm for drawing a circle. 

Sample output:
